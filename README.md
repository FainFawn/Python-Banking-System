# Python Banking System (Created at Age 14)

This is one of my earliest programming projects, created when I was 14 and just starting to learn Python on my own.

The project is a simple command-line banking system that includes:
- Account creation with password validation
- Login system using a unique account code
- Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
- Activity logging using `.txt` files
- Password change and account deletion options

🔐 While this project is not polished and was built with basic knowledge, it reflects my early passion for technology and programming. Today, I continue to grow my skills in Python, Linux (Kali), and cybersecurity.
